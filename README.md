# textgame
A skeleton mockup of a high-effort text game that I worked on.

## Features:
* In-game text editor (saving disabled in this version)
* Fully remappable keyboard controls
* Stylish UI and particle effects
* Text interpreter to import game scenes from .txt files
* Data-centric design for easy modding with .txt files
* AI with weighted decisions
* Turn-based combat system including status effects
* Multi-platform - runs on Android, Linux, OSX, and Windows

## Disclaimer
This is a *heavily* stripped version of the original project. As a byproduct some original features have been stripped, leaving some of the UI menus without purpose. It is a mockup, after all.
